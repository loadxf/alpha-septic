      question: "How often should I empty my RV black water tank?",
      answer:
        "As a general rule, empty your RV black water tank when it's about two-thirds full. For most RVers, this typically means every 3-5 days during active use. Never let it get completely full as this can cause backups and system damage.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use regular toilet paper in my RV toilet?",
      answer:
        "It's best to use RV-specific toilet paper that's designed to break down quickly in septic systems. Regular household toilet paper may not dissolve properly and can cause clogs in your RV's waste system.",
    },
    {
      question: "What should I do if my RV septic system develops odors?",
      answer:
        "First, ensure proper ventilation. Then check for leaks around seals and valves. Use enzyme-based RV tank treatments rather than harsh chemicals. Regular cleaning and proper waste breakdown will prevent most odor issues.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I prepare my RV septic system for winter storage?",
      answer:
        "Completely empty and flush both black and gray water tanks. Clean them thoroughly with an appropriate cleaner. Add RV antifreeze according to your RV manufacturer's instructions. Never use automotive antifreeze in your RV's water system.",

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-primary">Understanding Your RV Waste System</h2>

          <p className="mb-4">Most RVs have two separate waste water systems:</p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li className="mb-2">
              <span className="font-semibold">Black Water Tank:</span> Collects waste from the toilet
            </li>
            <li className="mb-2">
              <span className="font-semibold">Gray Water Tank:</span> Collects waste water from sinks and showers
            </li>
          </ul>

          <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm mb-8">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-primary">Essential Maintenance Tasks</h3>

              <div>
                <h4 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Regular Emptying</h4>
                <p>
                  Empty your black water tank when it's about two-thirds full and your gray water tank when it's nearly
                  full. Never travel with full or nearly full tanks as the sloshing can damage internal components.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h4 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Proper Chemicals</h4>
                <p>
                  Use enzyme-based treatments specifically designed for RV holding tanks. These help break down waste
                  and toilet paper while controlling odors without damaging your system.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h4 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Adequate Water</h4>
                <p>
                  Always keep some water in your black tank to help break down solids and prevent waste from sticking to
                  tank walls and sensors.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h4 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Sensor Maintenance</h4>
                <p>
                  Clean tank sensors periodically to ensure accurate readings. Buildup on sensors can cause false
                  readings, making it difficult to know when to empty your tanks.
