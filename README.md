   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Fill in the required environment variables
5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev

```bash
node scripts/pre-deployment-checklist.js
```

This script checks:
- Environment variables
- Security measures
- Image optimization
- SEO configuration
- API endpoints
- Build process
- Docker setup

## Deployment

### Option 1: Docker Deployment

1. Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed
2. Create a `.env` file with production values:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Generate secure secret values:
   ```bash
   node scripts/generate-secrets.js -u
   ```
4. Update `.env` with all required values

5. Build and run the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
6. For initial deployment or after major updates, build with no cache:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
7. The site will be available at http://localhost:3000 (or your configured port)

#### Setting up HTTPS with Nginx (Production)

The Docker setup includes an Nginx container configured for SSL/TLS. To use HTTPS:

1. Create SSL certificates (e.g., using Let's Encrypt):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p nginx/ssl/live/callalphaseptic.com
   # Copy your certificates to the proper location
   # - fullchain.pem to nginx/ssl/live/callalphaseptic.com/fullchain.pem
   # - privkey.pem to nginx/ssl/live/callalphaseptic.com/privkey.pem
   ```

2. Set your domain in the Nginx configuration in `nginx/conf.d/default.conf`

3. Restart the Nginx container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart nginx
   ```

For detailed instructions on Docker deployment, see the [Docker Deployment Guide](DOCKER-DEPLOYMENT.md).

### Option 2: Node.js Deployment

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Start the production server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

### Option 3: Vercel Deployment

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy the application

## Optimization Tools

The project includes several optimization tools:

- `scripts/optimize-images.js`: Identifies large images and provides optimization instructions
- `scripts/batch-optimize-images.js`: Automatically optimizes large images
- `scripts/check-page-rendering.js`: Analyzes rendering strategies for optimal performance

Run these tools as needed:

```bash
node scripts/check-page-rendering.js
node scripts/optimize-images.js
node scripts/batch-optimize-images.js
```

## Security

- Admin authentication is implemented with secure tokens
- CSRF protection is enabled for all forms
