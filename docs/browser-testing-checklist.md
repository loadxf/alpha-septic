4. Test any animated components (accordions, modals, etc.).

**Expected Results**:
- Animations should appear smooth and not jerky.
- Animations should be consistent across browsers.
- Animations should degrade gracefully if not supported.

### 6. Performance

**Test**: Check basic performance metrics.

1. Test page load times.
2. Check scrolling smoothness.
3. Test interactions with dynamic content.

**Expected Results**:
- Pages should load within reasonable time (ideally under 3 seconds).
- Scrolling should be smooth without lags.
- Interactive elements should respond promptly.

### 7. Media Handling

## Reporting Issues

For each issue found, document:

1. Browser and version
2. Device type and screen size
3. The page where the issue was found
4. The specific element with the issue
5. Screenshot or recording of the issue
6. Steps to reproduce

## Recommended Browser Testing Tools

- **Browser Stack** - Cross-browser testing platform
- **Lambda Test** - Cloud-based testing platform
- **Browser Dev Tools** - Built-in responsive design mode
- **Mobile Emulators** - Android Studio and Xcode simulators
- **Can I Use** - Feature compatibility reference

## Best Practices for Fixing Issues

1. **Normalize first** - Use CSS normalize or resets to create a consistent base
2. **Progressive enhancement** - Build for basic browsers first, then enhance
3. **Feature detection** - Use feature detection rather than browser detection
4. **Vendor prefixes** - Use autoprefixer to handle vendor prefixes
5. **Test fixes across all browsers** - Ensure a fix for one browser doesn't break others
